# Linux CUPS driver for Seiko SLP100/410/200/420/240/430/440/450/620/650/650E

This is a fork of Seiko's Linux driver for the above models, available at
http://siibusinessproducts.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SLP-400-600-SeikoSLPLinuxCUPSDriver.zip

I made some minor changes (basically adding missing includes) to make it compile under Ubuntu 17.10 and up.

For installation, `cd` into `src` and follow the instructions in `README.txt`.

Enjoy!
